# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

# Steps to be Followed

## STEP-1Ô∏è‚É£
 *Environment Variable must be in the Root directory.And it should start with (.) Eg:-``` .env ```

 Env file load only once usally ,so whenver you have update in env file you have close the project once then reopen the project.

 To prevent accidentally leaking env variables to the client, only variables prefixed with 'VITE_' are exposed to your Vite-processed code. e.g. for the following env variables:
```
 VITE_SOME_KEY=123
 DB_PASSWORD=foobar
```
ACCESS:
Only VITE_SOME_KEY will be exposed as 'import.meta.env.VITE_SOME_KEY' to your client source code, but DB_PASSWORD will not.

```
console.log(import.meta.env.VITE_SOME_KEY) // "123"
console.log(import.meta.env.DB_PASSWORD) // undefined
```


## STEP-2Ô∏è‚É£
TAKE all the environment variables from the Backend as a service(here AppWrite)

create a seperate folder as config and store all the env variable in an object by stringfying them...it is good practice and as well as to hide the sensitive info.

All the required environment variables are defined in (.env.sample)


## STEP-3Ô∏è‚É£
Here Services are made for 'CreateUser','login','logout', 'getUser' by making a structure of Class and each time a new user is created or registered an instance of that class is created as a object. 

Path: (src/appwrite/auth.js)

For more info check out: https://appwrite.io/docs/products/auth


## STEP-4Ô∏è‚É£
Here we configure the appwrite service databases like 'createPost','updatePost','deletePost','getPost' and file uploading services like 'uploadFile','deleteFile','getPreviewFile'. 

Path: (src/appwrite/config.js)

For more info check out://appwrite.io/docs/references/cloud/client-web/databases

while retrieving post based upon the status using getPost() method we have to write query:

```markdown
```javascript

 async getPosts(queries=[
    Query.equal("status","active")
 ]){
     try {
        return await this.databases.listDocuments(
            confEnv.appwriteDatabaseId,
            confEnv.appwriteCollectionId,
            queries,
        )
    } catch (error) {
        console.log("Appwrite service :: getPosts :: error",error);
        return false;
    }
 }
```

## STEP-5Ô∏è‚É£
Here State management is done  by using Redux Toolkit,and make the basic outlet in App.jsx and configure provider.
Configure the store to manage the states. 


## STEP-6Ô∏è‚É£
After above mentioned setups ,let us deep dive in component maikng .Main focus is reusiblity of components
for smooth and future proof acrhitecture.

In this given below syntax {value && ()}
if 'value' is 'true' then only the part in () is valid or redered further.

```markdown
```javascript
    {authStatus && (  <li><LogoutBtn/></li>  )} //if authService is   'true' then the list tag and LogoutBtn is visble
```

 
 Button desiging is shown below:
 ```markdown
 ```javascript
 function Button({
    children,type="button",
    bgColor='bg-blue-600',
    textColor='text-white',
    className='',
    ...props})
                     {
                    return (
                          <button 
                          className={`px-4 py-2 rounded-lg ${bgColor}
                           ${textColor} ${className} `}{...props}>
                              {children}
                          </button>
                     )
                    }
 ```

 Following similar kind of work-flow 'input' field of form and other redundant components will be designed.

 ## Concept of forwoard Reference in Input filedüìå
 Whenever you are making use of different component but you want to refer them in same page you have use this concept.

 Suppose we are making a law in firm and there are two fields like email address and password and both the input fields are being fixed from our component of input.So as a result as the components are individually separated the current context of that components are different.By using forward reference we can take both the different components as a single one and use them. 

 ```markdown
 ```javascript
//syatax 1
    const Input=React.forwardRef(function Input({})
    { 
        return (
           <div>
            <Input className='xyz' type='xyz' />
            </div>)
    });
//syatax 2
    const Input=React.forwardRef( Input=({})=>
    { 
        return (
           <div>
            <Input className='xyz' type='xyz' />
            </div>)
    });
 ```
